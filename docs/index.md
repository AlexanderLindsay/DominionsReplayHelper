  <summary>How do I use this?</summary>
  After downloading the zip file, run the DominionsReplayHelper.GUI.exe file. A console will open up with the app. If this is the first time running the app, it will ask for the path to the dominions 6 save folder. This is most likely in `AppData/Roaming/Dominions6/savedgames`, but the app expects the full path.

  <summary>Why should I use this</summary>
  This is useful if you are in multiplayer games of Dominions 6 and want to save a record of your turns for later review. It is easily enough to do this by hand or with a powershell script, its just copying and renaming a folder. This app removes the need for any manual work so long as the assumptions it is making match yours. Those assumptions are as follows: its a multiplayer game, you want to save a turn only once, you don't mind copying the entire folder, your are going to remember to run the script before the turn finishes.
